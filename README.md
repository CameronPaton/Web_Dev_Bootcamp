# Web_Dev_Bootcamp

### The Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp

---

The [Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), by Colt Steele, consists of 403 lectures organised into 42 sections. The course is full-stack so covers both the Frontend technologies and Backend technologies. 

There are exercises on each topic area and also projects. The main content of the course is based on:
* HTML
* CSS, Bootstrap and Flexbox
* Vanilla JavaScript
* JQuery
* The Command Line
* NodeJS
* ExpressJS
* APIs
* MongoDB

The early exercises and projects were useful for getting used to the technologies but pretty basic so I did these mainly in the console. I completed a Bootstrap project, but my first project I committed to this repo in the course was in Section 16 of 41 (JavaScript - Advanced DOM Manipulation) which was a Colour Game project. From then on I started to commit projects to this repo.
